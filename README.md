# Automated Canary Deployments

## Overview

This project demonstrates automated canary deployments using deployment scripts, rollback mechanisms, and infrastructure verification.

## Steps

### 1. Set Up the Web Application

- Create a simple web application in the `webapp` folder. (`webapp/app.py`)

### 2. Feature Branches

- Implement a new feature in a feature branch.

### 3. Canary Deployment Scripts

- Write deployment scripts in the `deployment` folder. (`deployment/deploy.sh`)

### 4. Testing and Rollback Logic

- Implement testing mechanisms and rollback scripts in the `rollback` folder. (`rollback/rollback.sh`)

### 5. Infrastructure Verification

- Create scripts to verify the infrastructure's health in the `verification` folder. (`verification/verify.sh`)

### 6. Run the Project

- Execute `deploy.sh` to perform a canary deployment.
- Monitor the application and infrastructure.
- Execute `rollback.sh` in case issues are detected.
- Run `verify.sh` to ensure the overall health of the infrastructure.

## Notes

- Adapt deployment, rollback, and verification scripts based on your specific deployment tools and infrastructure.
- Consider integrating automated testing as part of the canary deployment process.
- Replace placeholder values and logic with your actual deployment and verification mechanisms.

Feel free to customize and enhance the project according to your specific deployment requirements.
